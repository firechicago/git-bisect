This is a demo repository for my lightning talk about how to use `git bisect`. Check out the talk at https://www.facebook.com/vermonsterllc/videos/438711723137252/

You can see the official documentation for `git bisect` and all of the commands used in the talk at [git-scm.org](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect).

In order to run the test in this repository, you'll need Ruby and RSpec installed.

If you've seen the talk, you may be wondering what the heck `giti` is. This is just an alias I use for `git log` with a bunch of useful options. If you'd like to use it, just copy `alias giti="git log --graph --oneline --all --decorate"` into your .zshrc or .bashrc file.
